# Dataset:

## The dataset can be accessed at Virology AI Papers Repository. It includes a header row and
## multiple data rows generated from keyword-based searches. The list of keywords used for the searches is
## available here.


# Tasks


## Task 1:Implement semantic natural language processing techniques to filter out papers that do not meet the criteria of utilizing deep learning approaches in virology/epidemiology.

- step 1: preprocessing the dataset, and removed rows that has NaN in the Abstract column
- step 2: prepared a new dataframe , which has only "PMID" , "Title" , "Abstract" column where NAN rows are droped from 
- step 3:  


## Task 2: For the papers deemed relevant, classify them according to the type of method used: ["text mining", "computer vision", "both", "other"].





## Task 3: Extract and report the name of the method used for each relevant paper.
